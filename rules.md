These are the proposed guidelines governing the proper usage and upkeep of the Community Space at Bangalore.

<ul>
	<li>Selected Mozillians based in and around Bangalore will be the key holders of the space.</li>
	<li>The community space may be used by any member of the Mozilla India Community provided that he/she will be accompanied by a responsible 'Mozillian Key Holder'.</li>
	<li>Mozillians who will use the community space will be treated as "guests" of the available Key Holder who will be with them.</li>
	<li>The community space is open from 0900 to 2200 hours daily. Should there be a need to use the community space beyond (or even before) this timeframe, proper coordination must be done with the 'Space Wrangler' atleast 3 days ahead.</li>
	<li>Food and beverages are for the expense of the users.</li>
	<li>Please feel free to use the Pantry Area to avoid messing the working areas (and to avoid any untoward incidents like spilled liquids on laptops and devices, etc.)</li>
	<li>Please dispose off litter accordingly.</li>
	<li>The use of Meeting Rooms are on a First Come, First Served basis. Prior arrangement and reservation with the space host is a must.</li>
	<li>Names of meeting/event attendees (non-ReMo) must be given to the 'Space Wrangler' for security & logistics reason. Please fill this form after you enter the space.</li>
	<li>Proudly wear a mozilla shirt when visiting the space :)</li>
	<li>Vehicle parking at owner's risk.</li>
	<li>Though we promote a collaborative and fun working environment, horseplaying is not allowed and will not be tolerated while inside the community space. Be mindful of the other tenants in the building.</li>
	<li>Playing of loud music shall not be allowed.</li>
	<li>Feet off the walls.</li>
	<li>The Mozilla India Community shall not be held liable for any damage to equipment or fixture done by any individual using the community space.</li>
	<li>Always help keep the space clean before and after a event/meetup.</li>
	<li>Respect others privacy and time at the space.</li>
</ul>
