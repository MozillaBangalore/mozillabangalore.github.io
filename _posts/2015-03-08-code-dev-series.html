<p align="justify">We are starting a series of workshops at the community space starting with code-contribution to Mozilla Firefox (and general steps to start with most other open source projects).</p>

<center><p>REMOTE PARTICIPANTS WELCOME!</p></center>

<p align="justify">We've setup Google hangouts on air for live streaming. Check the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/103287207997822666808/103287207997822666808/videos">page for videos and events</a>. It doesn't matter where (which city/country) your're from, as long as the time (08:00 UTC) works for you.</p>

<p align="justify">Today, being the first part of the series, we covered the initial step, i.e. setup the developer environment & prepare yourself for jumping more in-depth (coming up next). By the end of the workshop, you should be able to run Firefox Nightly, that you've built yourself, on your own system!</p>
