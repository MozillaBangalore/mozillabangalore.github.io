[DuckDuckGo][duckduckgo] Bangalore Community hosted their [meet-up and hackathon][event] at the space. Quack & Hacks are for Developers interested in contributing to the DuckDuckGo search engine. The purpose of the meetup is to code open source "Instant Answers" for a variety of search topics. These "Instant Answers" will help users find results in few or zero clicks. Some examples are instantly finding out [who's in space right now][space], the [best reese's cookie recipes][recipies], or even a [regex cheat sheet][regex].
