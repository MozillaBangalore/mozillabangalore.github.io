<p align="justify"><a href="https://twitter.com/kaustavdm">Kaustav</a> hosted an event for Firefox OS keeping in mind the non-developers - "FirefoxOS for Everyone."<p>

<p align="justify">Firefox OS is an ecosystem in itself. Everyone, not just developers, can contribute to it, and help the ecosystem grow. The aim of this event is to help participants learn about Firefox OS from a user point-of-view. It will enable participants to talk about Firefox OS to non-developers, by understanding the core concepts, and learning to explain them in simple words.</p>
