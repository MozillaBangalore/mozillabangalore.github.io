<p align="justify">One of the outcome from the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/StudentAmbassadors/ExecutiveBoard/Roles">FSA Executive Board</a> meeting at Portland Work Week in December, 2014 was to have Office Hours every month. <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/StudentAmbassadors/Activities">Office Hour</a> is a monthly online meetup between E-Board and Ambassadors. We answer any questions you may have about the program. We also welcome Mozilla employees to join and teach students about a particular topic of interest.</p>

<p align="justify">We had 3 Office Hours from Dec till now. In January, we had Stacy Martin, Senior Manager of Privacy and Engagement at Mozilla talk about more about Privacy and celebrate Web Privacy day. In February, Rebecca Billings, Web QA Engineer, joined us as expalined more about One and Done and how Firefox Student Ambassadors can get started on it.</p>
