	<p align="justify">First, participants were made to set up their development environment and execute some existing instant answer on it. Later, they started to hack on their ideas to build new instant answers.</p>

	

	<p align="justify">To appreciate their efforts, all participants were awarded with a DuckDuckGo T-shirt. Yummy pizzas and sodas were served to the participants at the break.</p>

	<p align="justify">It was good to see that few of our mozillians were also part of this event and made their contributions to DuckDuckGo search engine by building instant answers.</p>
